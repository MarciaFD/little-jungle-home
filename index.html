                Aloe vera has been growing by people for numerous years and it is one of the most extensively used medicinal plants
                on the world.
                One important thing in the care of aloe vera is to understand this plant is a succulent, and like cacti, succulents 
                do best in dry conditions. Also, it is important to have the proper light, aloe vera plants need bright light, and 
                cannot tolerate standing water. The most common reason for an aloe plant dies is that the owners water too often, or
                do not allow the water to drain. Growing aloe vera indoor plant is not only easy but can also provide your family with a plant that can help treat minor burns and rashes.

                       Proper care for anthurium is not hard. Once you have the plant in the right soil and the right location, watering is simple.
                       Only water your anthurium when the soil is dry to the touch, but don’t overwater because the plant is susceptible to root rot,
                       so too much water can cause the roots to die.                                             
                       If you allow the plant to become too dry in a pot, it will slow down its growth and the rootball will be difficult to re-wet. If the rootball becomes too dry in the pot, soak the pot the anthurium plant is
                       in for an hour to rehydrate it. The plant only needs to be fertilized with a one-quarter strength fertilizer once every three
                       to four months. To get the best blooms, use a fertilizer that has a higher phosphorus number (the middle number).

                   Pilea peperomioides, often referred to as the Chinese money plant, coin plant, pancake plant, or UFO plant is a popular
                   houseplant thanks to its attractive coin-shaped foliage and ease of care. This plant has a unique appearance with straight stems
                   and coin-like leaves. It looks perfect in a short pot and is also very solid. 
                           
                   Typically, it requires watering once per week and will grow well in bright spaces. Remember, Money plant is one of these indoor
                   plants that don't need direct daylight because they like lots of indirect light but do poorly in direct sun. They should be placed near
                   a sunny window, but just far away from of the sun’s rays. They also like sandy, well-draining soil and should be allowed to dry out 
                   between waterings. They need very little feeding, but will do well with occasional additions of standard houseplant compost. 
                   It's a great idea for your home stylistic decor. You will love it!

                   Peacy lily is a common choice for offices and homes. When it comes to indoor plants, peace lily plants are the absolute

                   They are definitely more easy-going toward underwatering 
                   than overwatering, which is one of the most recognized explanations behind a harmony lily to kick the bucket. 
                   It is a result of this, you should to never water lily plants on a timetable.
                   Check them once per week to see if they should be watered. Basically touch the top of the soil to check whether it is dry.

                   will be sufficient to keep the plant blissful.

                   Snake plant care is very straightforward. These plants can be neglected for weeks at a time; yet, with
44                    their strappy leaves and architectural shape, they still look fresh. Additionally, they can survive low light levels, 
                   drought and have few insect problems. NASA research has even shown that snake plants are able to help keep the air inside your home clean, removing toxins such as formaldehyde and benzene. In short, they are the perfect houseplants.
                   One of the most common issues experienced/encountered with snake plants (and other succulents) is overwatering.
                   These plants don't endure wet soil well; they incline to develop root rot. To stay away from this, don't water too often times. 
                   Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Water from the lower part of the pot, if it is possible. This urges the roots 
                   to develop descending and profound, assisting with settling the thick, tall leaves.
